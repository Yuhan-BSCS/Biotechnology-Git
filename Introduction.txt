	The term “ biotechnology” was coined by a Hungarian engineer Karl Ereky, in 1919, to refer to the science and methods that permit products to be produced from raw materials with the aid of living organisms. Biotechnology is a diverse field which involves either working with living cells or using molecules derived from them for applications oriented toward human welfare using varied types of tools and technologies (Gupta et al., 2016). It is an amalgamation of biological science with engineering whereby living organisms or cells or parts are used for production of products and services. The main subfields of biotechnology are medical (red) biotechnology, agricultural (green) biotechnology, industrial (white) biotechnology, marine (blue) biotechnology, food biotechnology, and environmental biotechnology (Gupta et al., 2016).
​	Biotechnology began centuries ago when plants and animals were selectively bred and microorganisms were used to make beer, wine, cheese, and bread. However, the field gradually evolved, and it is now defined as the use or manipulation of living organisms to produce beneficial substances for medical, agricultural, and/or industrial use (Smith et al., 2023). Traditional biotechnology is defined as the use of living organisms for specific purposes such as bread/cheese production, whereas modern biotechnology is concerned with the use of cellular molecules such as DNA, monoclonal antibodies, biologics, and so on. Before we get into the technical advances of DNA and thus recombinant DNA technology, let us first understand what DNA is and what it does.
	Biotechnology, at its core, is the manipulation of biological materials such as cells, genes, and proteins in order to develop new products, processes, and technologies. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and disciplines, including genetic engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry, and microbiology, to unravel the mysteries of life and apply that knowledge to practical applications.
Researchers in the field of medical biotechnology use biotechnological tools to develop new treatments, diagnostics, and therapies for human health. This includes the creation of biopharmaceuticals, gene therapies, personalized medicine, and diagnostic tests that allow for the early detection of disease and the development of precise treatment strategies.
	Meanwhile, agricultural biotechnology aims to increase crop yields, improve nutritional content, and develop plants that are more resistant to pests, diseases, and environmental stressors. Agricultural biotechnologists use techniques such as genetic modification, tissue culture, and marker-assisted breeding to develop sustainable and resilient crops that can meet the growing demand for food in a changing world.
	Industrial biotechnology is the use of biological processes and organisms to create environmentally friendly and efficient manufacturing processes. This includes the development of biofuels, bioplastics, enzymes, and other bio-based products that reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help to create a more sustainable industrial sector. Waste management, pollution control, and the development of green technologies all benefit from industrial biotechnology.
Environmental biotechnology addresses environmental issues by harnessing the power of microorganisms and biological systems. Researchers in this field work on developing novel approaches to waste treatment, pollutant bioremediation, and the generation of renewable energy sources. Environmental biotechnologists strive to create a healthier and more sustainable environment by harnessing the potential of nature's own mechanisms.
	Biotechnology is a rapidly changing field that is fueled by new discoveries, technological advances, and interdisciplinary collaborations. It has the potential to significantly improve many aspects of our lives, including healthcare, agriculture, industry, and environmental conservation. However, it raises ethical and societal issues that must be carefully considered (Gupta et al., 2016). Biotechnology, as a field with limitless potential, continues to shape our world and holds the promise of a brighter, more sustainable future. Through research, innovation, and responsible application, biotechnology has the potential to address pressing global issues, improve human well-being, and protect the environment for future generations.
